BBS Reforge
===========

BBS Reforge is a fully updated and modernized continuation of the original
BBS Mod by McHorse, rebuilt and adapted for Minecraft 1.21.1.
Its purpose is to restore the powerful BBS animation tools for modern
Minecraft versions while keeping the mod lightweight, stable, and
creator-friendly.

BBS Reforge includes tools for creating cinematic scenes, machinimas,
roleplay sequences, and animated content directly inside Minecraft.

More information will be available soon on the official Modrinth page.
